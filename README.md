How To Use
----------

The `TestOverlay` component works as an image effect, so it has to be added to
a camera object. It simply overdraws the entire screen with the test signals.

Currently four signal modes are available for use.

- Fill: simply fill the entire screen with a given color.
- Spectrum: draws the color spectrum bars.
- Checker: draws the checker pattern with a given scale.
- Pattern: draws the TV test pattern.
