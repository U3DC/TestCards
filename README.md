How To Use
----------

The `TestOverlay` component works as an image effect, so it has to be added to
a camera object before using. It simply overdraws the entire screen with a test
pattern.

Currently four pattern modes are available for use.

- **Fill**: simply fill the entire screen with a given color.
- **Spectrum**: draws a grayscale bar and a color spectrum bar.
- **Checker**: draws a checker pattern with a given scale.
- **Pattern**: draws a TV test pattern.
